## Assignment 11 and 12 Questions

Note: this questions file is designed to help you document what you've done in your assignment. It is important as this is the way we will understand what you have done for grading.

An example `QUESTIONS.md` file is in the `Examples` directory (QUESTIONS-example.md).

## Assignment 11

The rubric has a list of 13 items.

Item 2: List at least 3 distinct behaviors. If you have made more than 3, list up to 5 and choose the ones you think are most interesting. A single sentence describing each one should be sufficient.

2.A: Helicopter flies, lands at a helipad, takes off, chooses a destination and flies there.(Helicopter from example code.)<br>
2.B: Cars, truck and buses drives around in a coordinated fasion.<br>
2.C: Train moves in arc-length parameterization on a Bezier curve.<br>
2.D: Carousel, tilt-a-whirl and swings moving.<br>
2.E: A helicopter flying in a circle.<br>

Item 3: Do you have a spline train track? What object should we look at? How do we know it's a spline?<br>
Yes. Please look at 'Train', implemented in "train.js". You could see it is a spline from the curve shape and the train moves in arc-length parameterization. You could also see my code in train.js for the implementation.

Item 4: Do you have a train that faces forward on the track and is rideable?<br>
Yes. The helicopter made by myself and the train are rideable with reasonable camera positions.

Optional Complexity Points: For each one that you've done, give the number (5-13) on the list, describe the behavior, and tell us what object we can see it on. This might take 2-3 sentences per item.<br>
7. The helicopter comes with the example code flies, lands at a helipad, takes off, chooses a destination and flies there. Please LookAt 'Example Helicopter'.<br>
8. The fireball in the center of the town changes shape, according to the speed slide. Please LookAt 'FireBall'. <br>
9. The carousel, tilt-a-whirl and swings are articulated objects, and move in key-framed fasion. Please LookAt 'Carousel', 'Tilt-a-Whirl', 'Swing-1' and 'Swing-2'.<br>

List which other "Behavior Challenges" you completed (from the list of 13 - anything 5 and above). For each, give the number as well as a short (1 sentence is OK) description. And tell us where in the world to see it (what object should we "lookat" and/or "ride"):<br>
7.8.9. from above.<br>
11. A driving system. Cars, truck and buses move in a coordinated fasion on roads. Please LookAt 'Yellow Car', 'White Car', 'Truck', 'Blue Bus', 'Purple Bus' or 'Roads'.<br>
12. The train moves in arc-length parameterization. Please LookAt 'Train', or follow/ride 'Train'.<br>

## Assignment 12

Object Diversity: List 8 of the different kinds of objects that appear in your world. If you made more than 8 kinds of objects, only list the 8 that are most interesting visually.

O.1 Flowers
O.2 Two types of helicopers
O.3 Three types of houses, lighthouse
O.4 Train
O.5 Cars
O.6 Truck
O.7 Bus
O.8 Carousel

Object Diversity: list one object in your world that is loaded from a model file (e.g., OBJ or FBX). Remember to give proper attribution in your README file, and to include the object in your repository.
The pillar under the fireball is loaded from an OBJ file.<br>

Object Diversity: list one of each category<br>
Building: lighthouse, type I houses (blue), type II houses (brown), type III houses (yellow).<br>
Natural Element: flowers, fireball, pillar<br>
Vehicle (object meant to move): cars, buses, truck, helicopters (2 types), train<br>

Technical Challenges: For each technical challenge you attempted (from the list of 7), give the number of the challe nge, a description of whatyou did, and a description of the object that it was used on. What objects should we "look at".<br>
1 The fireball changes its surface from curved sphere to fire-like shape.<br>
3 A procedural texture in a shader. This can be seen on the gate at the amusement park. Please LookAt 'GrSquareSign-0' ~ 'GrSquareSign-3'.<br>
6 Two-pass rendering on four flags that reflects the view from its position to the center of town. Please LookAt 'Flag-1' ~ 'Flag-4'.<br>
7 Skybox has a snowy mountainous background.<br>

Pictures: confirm that you placed the required pictures in the Pictures directory.
Yes.<br>
Consent: do you agree to allow us to use your pictures in future gallery pages? (please answer Yes or No)
Yes.<br>
